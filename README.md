# Steam Rails

Steam Rails is a game developed using Pygame, in which up to three players can explore an infinite steampunk-themed train, fighting monsters and getting stronger after each room.

Each wagon is a procedurally-generated room with different enemies and challenges to overcome. After defeating enemies, they might drop items that will modify the attributes of the player that gets them. After every ten rooms, enemies get stronger too.

There are ten options of weapons that can be found throughout the train, divided between ranged and melee weapons. Each weapon has its own stats, like attack speed, damage, and range.
